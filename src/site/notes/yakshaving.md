# Yak Shaving and Rabbit Holes
#curiosity 
modified: 2022-03-04

The definition of [Yak Shaving](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving) on Wiktionary:
> 1.  Any apparently useless activity which, by allowing you to overcome intermediate difficulties, allows you to solve a larger problem. " _I was doing a bit of **yak shaving** this morning, and it looks like it might have paid off._"
    
> 2.  A less useful activity done consciously or subconsciously to procrastinate about a larger but more useful task. "_I looked at a reference manual for my car just to answer one question, but I spent the whole afternoon with my nose buried in it, just **yak shaving**, and got no work done on the car itself._"

This is really the story of my life. I just can't stay away from the rabbit holes. I have to follow where my [curiosity leads](learningnow.md).
