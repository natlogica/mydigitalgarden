# About These Notes
#home 
modified: 2022-03-04

Welcome to my digital garden!

This will be an entry point to the pool of notes. I would like to put a word cloud in here somewhere.

The index should allow for easy navigation.

It should link to the main paths, like this one [Yak Shaving and Rabbit Holes](yakshaving.md). The links are very important to form the network of ideas. Using the markdown format for links might get a bit tiresome, especially if I have to maintain them manually. I like having the filename stay consistent, though, even if the title evolves. I want to only have to change the title in the metadata, though, so I need the page title to be automated from that information.

I'm [curious about many things](learningnow.md) right now. I have done a little bit of work writing stories in Twine, and it turns out that I can do the same thing here. I'm feeling excited about hypertext again!
